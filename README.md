## Appendix

This project was created as a way to sharpen my skills in Tailwind CSS and React, focusing on writing better component semantics and optimizing performance. And what better way to do that than by building an eCommerce app?

To make the project more complete and functional, I added a few key dependencies:

**· React Router:**  The go-to library for handling navigation in React apps.

**· Leaflet:**  A lightweight, open-source library for creating interactive maps, and a great alternative to Google Maps.

**· Zustand:** A simple but powerful state management library.

**· Express:** A fast, open-source framework used in the backend to handle API requests..

**· JSDocs:** A great choice for getting started with markup languages—simple, fast, and easy to read. It's an excellent stepping stone before diving into the widely popular       TypeScript.


## Experience & Learnings

Working on this project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS while also improving code semantics and performance optimization.

Through React Router, I became more comfortable handling navigation and dynamic routing, which is essential for building scalable React applications. Integrating Leaflet introduced me to interactive maps, providing a lightweight and flexible alternative to Google Maps.

For state management, Zustand proved to be a simple yet powerful tool, reinforcing the importance of maintaining clean and efficient global state handling. On the backend, using Express helped me gain hands-on experience in setting up APIs and managing server-side logic.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity to apply and refine my skills while exploring new tools and best practices in modern web development.
